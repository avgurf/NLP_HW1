Short
for
natural
language
processing
a
branch
of
artificial
intelligence
that
deals
with
analyzing
understanding
and
generating
the
languages
that
humans
use
naturally
in
order
to
interface
with
computers
in
both
written
and
spoken
contexts
using
natural
human
languages
instead
of
computer
languages
.
One
of
the
challenges
inherent
in
natural
language
processing
is
teaching
computers
to
understand
the
way
humans
learn
and
use
language
.
Take
for
example
the
sentence
``
Baby
swallows
fly
.
''
This
simple
sentence
has
multiple
meanings
depending
on
whether
the
word
``
swallows
''
or
the
word
``
fly
''
is
used
as
the
verb
which
also
determines
whether
``
baby
''
is
used
as
a
noun
or
an
adjective
.
In
the
course
of
human
communication
the
meaning
of
the
sentence
depends
on
both
the
context
in
which
it
was
communicated
and
each
person��s
understanding
of
the
ambiguity
in
human
languages
.
This
sentence
poses
problems
for
software
that
must
first
be
programmed
to
understand
context
and
linguistic
structures
.
