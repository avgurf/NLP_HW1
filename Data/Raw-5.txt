A distinguishing feature of the Stanford NLP Group is our effective combination of sophisticated and deep linguistic modeling and data analysis with innovative probabilistic and machine learning approaches to NLP. Our research has resulted in state-of-the-art technology for robust, broad-coverage natural-language processing in many languages. These technologies include our competition-winning coreference resolution system; a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger; a high performance probabilistic parser; a competition-winning biological named entity recognition system; and algorithms for processing Arabic, Chinese, and German text.
